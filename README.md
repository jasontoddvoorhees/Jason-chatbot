An interactive Character chatbot experience featuring Jason Voorhees from the Legendary franchise, Friday the 13th. Chat with the legendary of Crystal Lake in this semi-canon, lore-accurate conversation simulator built for horror fans.

## 💬 What to Expect

Jason is **not** your typical chatbot. He's:
- Emotionally stunted and traumatized
- Driven by instinct, memory, and Mother's voice!
- Limited in some languages but capable of conversation
- A **comfort character** for horror fans who see him as more than a monster

**This is semi-canon:** Faithful to established lore but adapted for interactive chat to engage users and keep them coming back.
